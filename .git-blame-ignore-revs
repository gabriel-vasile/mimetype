# Github is obeying this ignore file by default.
# Run this command on local to ignore formatting commits in `git blame`
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Added a new column to supported_mimes.md
# The supported_mimes.md file was a nice way to find when a file format was
# introduced. However, when I changed to add a new column in the table, the
# whole git blame got poisoned for the file.
